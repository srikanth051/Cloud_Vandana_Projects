# Coding Assignment - Associate Software Engineer

This repository contains my solutions for the **Associate Software Engineer Assignment** provided by Cloud Vandana. The assignment includes multiple tasks covering front-end development, Java programming, and DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

## Assignment Overview

### 1. Profile Card (HTML & CSS)
- Designed a **responsive profile card**.
- Included:
  - Profile picture
  - Name and designation
  - A short bio
  - Social media icons (some links are not provided, so placeholders are used)
- The card is centered and adapts to different screen sizes.
- Added **hover effect animations** using CSS.

### 2. String Manipulation - Anagram Check (Java)
- Developed a **Java program** to check whether two strings are anagrams.
- Example inputs and outputs:
  ```java
  Input: "listen", "silent"  // Output: true
  Input: "hello", "world"   // Output: false
  ```
- Uses sorting and comparison for anagram verification.

### 3. Object-Oriented Programming - Employee Management System (Java)
- Created a **Java class `Employee`** with the following attributes:
  - `id` (integer)
  - `name` (string)
  - `salary` (double)
- Implemented a method `displayDetails()` to print employee details.
- Created at least **three Employee objects**.
- Stored them in a **list** and displayed their details.

### 4. To-Do List (JavaScript & DOM Manipulation)
- Built a **simple to-do list** using JavaScript.
- Features:
  - Users can **add new tasks**.
  - Tasks are displayed in a list.
  - Each task has a **delete button** to remove it from the list.

### 5. Image Slider (JavaScript & DOM Manipulation)
- Implemented an **image slider** using JavaScript.
- Features:
  - Displays **one image at a time**.
  - Includes "Next" and "Previous" buttons for navigation.
  - Uses an **array of image URLs** to load different images dynamically.


## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS** (for Profile Card & To-Do List UI)
- **JavaScript** (for To-Do List and Image Slider)
- **Java** (for Anagram Check & Employee Management System)
